## GNU
GNU, which stands for "GNU's Not Unix," is a prominent project in the realm of free and open-source software (FOSS), initiated by Richard Stallman and overseen by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).[^stallman95gnu] The project commenced in 1983, driven by concerns regarding the restrictive nature of software and licensing practices. It aims to create a Unix-compatible operating system entirely composed of free software, embodying the principles of software freedom.

At its core, GNU is guided by the philosophy of software freedom, advocating for users' rights to study, modify, and distribute software without restrictions. One of its pivotal contributions is the GNU General Public License (GPL), a copyleft license designed to ensure that software remains free and open for all users. This approach fosters collaboration and innovation within a community-driven ecosystem.

Key components of the GNU project include the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), a suite of compilers supporting various programming languages, and GNU Emacs, a highly extensible text editor. These tools, alongside numerous other utilities and libraries, form the foundation of GNU/Linux distributions, which combine the GNU software stack with the Linux kernel.[^meyers05gnu]

GNU's impact extends beyond individual software components, shaping the landscape of free software development and fostering the growth of open ecosystems.[^raymond01gnu] It represents a paradigm shift in the world of software, challenging proprietary models and advocating for a more inclusive and equitable approach to technology.
